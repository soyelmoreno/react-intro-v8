# react-intro-v8

Following along with this course on [Frontend
Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/): [Complete Into to React,
v8](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-react-v8/). Well actually, this
time I'm just following along with the course website, in order to get the code
in a state where I can take Intermediate React v5.

The course website is here: https://react-v8.holt.courses/ .
