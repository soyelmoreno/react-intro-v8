# Complete Intro to React v8, plus Intermediate React v5

Adopt Me is a pet finder app written in React. This app gets built as a part of
the course on [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/): [Complete Intro
to React, v8](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/archive/complete-react-v8/)
And actually, this time I'm just following along with the course website, in
order to get the code in a state where I can take Intermediate React v5.

The course website is here: https://react-v8.holt.courses/ . Project files are
here: https://github.com/btholt/citr-v8-project/

The website and Github repo remain free and open source even when your Frontend
Masters subscription expires.

[Intermediate React
v5](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/archive/intermediate-react-v5/) builds
on this repo. The branch "intermediate-react-v5" contains changes to the pet
finder files that were made in the intermediate course.
